          Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br>
          1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves, chopped<br>
          1 tablespoon roasted and salted peanuts, roughly chopped<br>

Add the scallion whites and jalapeños and cook, stirring, until the jalapeños are soft and the seeds start to turn golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the ginger and cook, stirring, until soft, about 1 minute. Reduce the heat to medium and stir in the chili sauce mixture. Bring a boil and let cook until slightly thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Set aside and keep warm.<br>
            3. Fill a large heavy-bottom pot, fitted with a deep fry thermometer, with 2-inches of oil and heat the oil to 350 degrees F over medium-high heat. Set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet.<br>

Remove the cauliflower with the slotted spoon and transfer to the rack. Sprinkle with salt. Fry the remaining cauliflower, in 2 more batches, making sure the temperature of the oil comes back to 350 degrees F between each batch.<br>
            5. Add the fried cauliflower, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper to the sauce and gently toss to coat well. Transfer to a serving platter and sprinkle with cilantro, peanuts and the reserved scallion greens.<br>

          1 medium poblano chile<br> 
          3 tablespoons olive oil<br>  
          1 chipotle pepper and 2 tablespoons adobo sauce (from one 7-ounce can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce)  
          2 cloves garlic<br>   
          2 teaspoons low-sodium soy sauce<br>
          2 teaspoons tomato paste<br>  
          1 teaspoon chili powder<br>  
          1 teaspoon red wine vinegar<br>  
          1/2 teaspoon ground cumin<br>  
          Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br>  
          One 14-ounce package extra-firm tofu, drained well<br>   
          Brown rice, for serving<br>
          Black beans, for serving<br>
          Shredded romaine lettuce, for serving<br>  
          Prepared pico de gallo, for serving<br>
        </p>
          <p>METHOD<br>
            1. Preheat the oven to broil.<br>
            2. Place the onion wedges and poblano on a rimmed baking sheet and rub with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Broil, turning several times with tongs, until the poblano has collapsed in on itself and the vegetables are charred, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the oven. When the poblano is cool enough to handle, remove and discard the skin, stem and seeds.<br>
            3. Transfer the poblano to a blender. Add the charred onion wedges, chipotle pepper and adobo sauce, garlic, soy sauce, tomato paste, chili powder, vinegar, cumin, 1/2 cup water, 3/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Blend until smooth, then set the poblano mixture aside.<br>
            4. Cut the tofu crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick planks, then press the pieces between a couple paper towels to remove as much moisture as possible. Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the tofu and cook until well browned, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate to cool.<br> 
            5. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in the same skillet, then add the diced onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 6 minutes. Using your hands, tear and crumble the tofu into very small pieces and add to the skillet. Cook, stirring to combine, until warmed through, about 2 minutes.<br> 
            6. Add the poblano mixture and 1/2 cup water to the skillet and cook until it’s bubbling all over and the tofu has absorbed some of the sauce, about 5 minutes. Add 1 to 2 more tablespoons water if the mixture gets too dry (it should be saucy). Taste and add more salt and pepper, if needed.<br> 
            7. Serve over rice and beans and top with lettuce and pico de gallo.<br>

        <h3>Creamy Orzo with Mushrooms</h3>
        <p>INGREDIENTS<br>
          8 ounces cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced<br>
          3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br>
          Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper<br>
          1 large leek (white and light green parts only), sliced and rinsed<br>
          2 cloves garlic, minced<br>
          12 ounces orzo<br>
          3 cups milk<br>
          1 1/2 cups shredded Italian cheese blend (about 6 ounces)<br>
          1 5-ounce package baby spinach (about 8 cups)<br>
          Grated zest and juice of 1 lemon<br>
          2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley<br>
        </p>  
        <p>METHOD<br>
          1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Toss the mushrooms with 2 tablespoons olive oil, a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper on a baking sheet.<br>
          2. Spread out in a single layer. Roast, stirring halfway through, until well browned and crisp around the edges, about 25 minutes. Let cool for a few minutes, then scrape up with a spatula and transfer to a bowl.<br>
          3. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the leek and garlic, season with salt and pepper and cook until the leek softens, about 2 minutes. Add the orzo, 2 cups water, the milk, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the orzo is al dente, 5 to 7 minutes.<br>
          4. Remove from the heat and add the cheese, spinach, lemon juice and 1 tablespoon parsley. Stir until the cheese melts and the spinach wilts; add a splash of water if the mixture is too thick. Season with salt and pepper.<br>
          5. Toss the mushrooms with the lemon zest and remaining 1 tablespoon parsley. Divide the orzo among bowls and top with the mushroom mixture.<br>
