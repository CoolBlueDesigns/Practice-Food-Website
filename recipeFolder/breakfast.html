       <h3>Veggie Packed Frittata</h3>
       <p> INGREDIENTS<br>
        2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br>
        1 small green bell pepper, diced<br>
        1 small red bell pepper, diced <br>
        1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced<br>
        2 cups packed baby spinach<br>
        1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes (not packed in oil), chopped<br>
        1 clove garlic, sliced<br>
        10 large eggs, beaten<br>
        Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br>
        Hot sauce, for serving<br>
       </p>
         <p>METHOD<br>
           1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br>
           2. Heat the oil in a medium oven-safe nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the bell peppers and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 6 to 7 minutes. Add the spinach, sun-dried tomatoes and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until the spinach is just wilted and still vibrant green, about 1 minute.<br> 
           3. Reduce the heat to low and add the eggs, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Stir gently to distribute the vegetables. Bake until the eggs are set, 13 to 15 minutes.<br>
           4. Let stand for 5 minutes, then slice into 6 pieces. Serve with hot sauce. Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 1 week.<br>

       <h3>Heart-Shaped Whole-Wheat Pancakes with Strawberry Sauce</h3>
       <p>INGREDIENTS<br>
        3/4 cup all-purpose flour<br>
        3/4 cup whole-wheat flour<br>
        1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder<br>
        1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br>
        1/4 teaspoon salt<br>
        2 large eggs<br>
        1 cup low-fat buttermilk<br>
        1/2 cup non-fat milk<br>
        1 tablespoon honey<br>
        1/4 teaspoon vanilla<br>
        Strawberry sauce, recipe follows<br>
        Confectioners' sugar, optional<br>
       </p>
       <p>INGREDIENTS FOR STRAWBERRY SAUCE<br>
        16 ounces strawberries, fresh or frozen (unsweetened, thawed)<br>
        1 teaspoon lemon juice<br>
        2 tablespoons maple syrup<br>
       </p>  
       <p>METHOD<br>
         1. Preheat oven to 200 degrees F. Preheat a large nonstick griddle or skillet over a medium-low flame.
         2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients (flour through salt). In another medium bowl, beat together the eggs, buttermilk, non-fat milk, honey and vanilla.<br>
         3. Stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, mixing only enough to combine them. The batter will be somewhat lumpy.<br>
         3. Use a 1/3 cup measuring cup to ladle the batter onto the griddle or skillet. Flip the pancake when the top is bubbling and it is golden brown on the bottom. Then cook until the other side is golden brown. Hold on an oven proof plate in the oven until the entire batch is ready. When all the pancakes are ready, cut them into heart shapes with a heart shaped cookie cutter. Ladle about 1/3 cup of the strawberry sauce onto each plate, place pancakes on top and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar, if using.<br>
        <br> 
        Strawberry Sauce:<br>
         Yield: 4 servings (serving size about 1/3 cup)<br>
         1. Puree strawberries to a chunky puree. Heat them in a small saucepan over a low flame, until they are just warm. Stir in lemon juice and maple syrup.<br>
