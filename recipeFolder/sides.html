     <h3>Roasted Carrots with Dill</h3>
     <p>INGREDIENTS:<br>
       12 carrots<br>
       3 tablespoons good olive oil<br>
       1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt <br>
       1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper<br>
       2 tablespoons minced fresh dill or parsley<br>
     </p>
       <p>METHOD:<br>
         1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
         2. If the carrots are thick, cut them in half lengthwise; if not, leave whole. Slice the carrots diagonally in 1 1/2-inch-thick slices. (The carrots will shrink while cooking so make the slices big.) Toss them in a bowl with the olive oil, salt, and pepper. Transfer to a sheet pan in 1 layer and roast in the oven for 20 minutes, until browned and tender.<br>
         3. Toss the carrots with minced dill or parsley, season to taste, and serve.<br>

     <h3>Spiced Citrus Baby Kale</h3>
     <p> INGREDIENTS<br>
      1 tablespoon unsalted butter<br>
      1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil<br>
      1 large shallot, minced<br>
      Juice of 1 orange plus 1 teaspoon of zest (about 1/3 cup juice)<br>
      Juice of 1/2 medium lemon (about 1 tablespoon)<br>
      Two 5-ounce packages fresh baby kale<br>
      Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br>
      1/4 teaspoon ground coriander<br>
      1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes<br>
     </p>
       <p>METHOD<br>
        Melt the butter with the oil in a large deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the orange juice and lemon juice and cook until reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Add the kale in batches, tossing with tongs until it begins to wilt, then adding more; continue until all the kale is wilted, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the orange zest, 3/4 teaspoon salt, a few grinds of black pepper, coriander and red pepper flakes and toss to combine. Transfer the kale with tongs to a serving bowl or platter and serve warm.

     <h3>Roasted Moraccoan-Style Veggies</h3>
     <p>INGREDIENTS<br>
       Nonstick cooking spray<br>
       5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br>
       Juice of 1/2 small lemon (about 1 tablespoon)<br>
       2 large cloves garlic, minced<br>
       Kosher salt<br>
       1 teaspoon ground coriander <br>
       1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br>
       1/4 teaspoon ground cumin <br>
       1/4 teaspoon ground ginger<br>
       1 large yellow onion, diced<br>
       1 medium eggplant (about 1 pound), unpeeled, cut into 1/2-inch cubes<br>
       1 medium sweet potato (about 12 ounces), unpeeled, scrubbed and cut into 1/2-inch cubes<br>
       1 cup grape tomatoes, halved<br>
       8 dried apricots, thinly sliced, or 2 packed tablespoons golden raisins <br>  
       1/2 cup loosely packed fresh cilantro leaves, chopped<br>
     </p> 
     <p>METHOD<br>
       1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Spray two rimmed baking sheets with nonstick cooking spray.<br>
       2. Whisk together 3 tablespoons of the oil, lemon juice, garlic, 2 teaspoons salt, coriander, cinnamon, cumin and ginger in a large bowl. Add the onions, eggplant, sweet potatoes and tomatoes and toss well to fully coat the vegetables. Divide among the prepared baking sheets and arrange in a single layer. Roast until the sweet potatoes and eggplant are lightly browned and fully softened, 50 to 55 minutes, rotating trays and switching from top to bottom halfway through.<br>
       3. Transfer the vegetables to a large bowl. Toss with the apricots, cilantro and remaining 2 tablespoons of oil. Season to taste with salt.<br>
