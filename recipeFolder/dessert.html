     <h3>Chocolate Bark</h3>
     <p> INGREDIENTS<br>
       12 ounces semi-sweet or dark chocolate (50% to 60%)<br>
       ⅓ cup dried cranberries<br>
       ⅓ cup chopped pistachios<br>
       ⅓ cup large coconut flakes<br>
       ½ teaspoon chunky sea salt (or smoked sea salt)<br>
     </p>
       <p>METHOD<br>
         1. Prep: Start a small saucepan of barely simmering water. Chop the chocolate into 1/2-inch chunks. In a heat-proof bowl that is completely dry that will fit over the pan of simmering water, add about 2/3 of the chocolate chunks. We used a small metal bowl; you can also use a double boiler if you have one. Make sure not to get any water into the chocolate, since it will cause the chocolate to seize up! (There are fixes for seized chocolate but it’s not pretty.)<br>
         2. Melt the chocolate to a temperature of 108 to 115°F: Hold the bowl with the chocolate above the other saucepan with boiling water to create a double boiler (or use your double boiler). Place a towel on counter next to the stove so that you can transfer the bowl to the counter as necessary and avoid any water getting into the bowl. Hold the bowl of chocolate over the simmering water for a few seconds, until the chocolate starts to melt. Remove from the bowl to the towel and stir and stir to continue melting. Check the temperature with a food thermometer, and continue going back and forth from the water for a few seconds to the towel until fully melted. The target temperature is 108 to 115°F, but do not allow the chocolate to go higher than 115°F.<br>
         3. Add the unmelted chocolate and reduce to 85 to 86°F: Once the chocolate is fully melted and at 108 to 115°F, add the remaining third of the unmelted chocolate (called seed chocolate) and stir constantly until it melts and the chocolate temperature falls to 85 to 86°F. This will take up to 10 minutes, but it is worth the wait! Stir regularly for the entire time to ensure an even temperature. (While it melts, you can chop the pistachios.)<br>
         4. Heat back to 90 to 91°F: When the chocolate is 85°F, return the bowl of chocolate to above the pan of simmering water for a couple seconds at a time until climbs back to 90 to 91°F. Now the chocolate is tempered!<br>
         5. Add mix-ins and spread in a thin layer: Add half the cranberries, chopped pistachios and coconut flakes to the melted chocolate and stir until fully combined. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Using a spatula, spread the chocolate mixture over the parchment paper in an even layer to a size of about 8″ by 11″. Sprinkle the remaining toppings over the top, crushing the coconut and chunky sea salt with your fingers to make smaller pieces.<br>
         6. Refrigerate: Refrigerate at 30 minutes until hardened. When hard, cut into irregular 2 to 3 inch pieces with a butter knife. Store in an airtight container at refrigerated for up to 3 weeks or frozen for 3 months.<br>

       Flaked sea salt, for garnish<br>
       Sesame seeds, for garnish (optional)<br>
     </p> 
     <p>METHOD<br>
       1. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with cupcake liners.<br> 
       2. In a glass measuring cup, place the tahini, cocoa powder, coconut oil, maple syrup, vanilla extract, cinnamon and kosher salt. Microwave 20 seconds, then stir until full combined and smooth but not hot. Stir in the rolled oats.<br>
       3. Spoon about 2 tablespoons each into the cupcake liners and spread if necessary to make flat cookies in the bottom of the cups. Top with sesame seeds and flaked sea salt. Freeze for 20 minutes. Store refrigerated or frozen. Keep refrigerated as close as possible to serving.<br>
